#' Estimate causal effect using doubly robust estimators in high dimensions

#'                       covariates are continuous
#' @param y_type         A categorical variable indicating whether y is binary or continuous.
#'                       Possible values are "binary" or "continuous", and the program defaults
#'                       to "continuous"
#' @param dfY            the degrees of freedom of the splines used to model the relationship between

#'                       priors instead of splines then dfY should be set to "GP"

#' @param nBoot          The number of resampling iterations to use when estimating the confidence
#'                       intervals
#' @param lower          The lowest value the estimated propensity score can take in the DR estimator. 
#'                       This parameter defaults to 0 so that the propensity score is not trimmed.
#' @param upper          The largest value the propensity score can take in the DR estimator. This
